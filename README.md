# Project App Spotify 2.0 #3

JavaScript is a very popular and versatile programming language that is widely used in web development. It supports a wide range of platforms and devices, and is a good choice for projects involving data manipulation and user interaction.

This project was developed in 20 hours, thanks to a tutorial on YouTube, JavaScriptMastery thanks to him I was able to make this great project called Spotify 2.0, I hope it will be useful for future projects, or so you can improve your knowledge in React!
